#A database custom built by Charlotte Chaze <3 (I have used only part of the database for my query.)
#Many teachers are leaving their jobs and getting hired as data analysts at EdTech companies. This database contains information that an EdTech company like McGraw-Hill would have. 
#This example data is fabricated for demonstration purposes.

    TextbookID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    Title TEXT,
    PublicationYear INTEGER,
    CourseID INTEGER);

#I created a table to show the name and publication date of textbooks that are currently in use.  
#I have identified the books by their publication date and indicated if they are to be kept or replaced.  
#Textbooks that have a publication date of 2020 or later will be kept, and textbooks with a publication date before 2020 will be replaced.  
#I have grouped the books by name.
